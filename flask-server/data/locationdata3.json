Later on, when the Chola dynasty fell on hard times and lost its glory, the Masinagudi tribal people found that farming, animal husbandry, and the collecting of snakes were suitable professions for them. They first produced antidotes for snake bites and then, over time, migrated to serve people in Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Karnataka whose snakes had bitten in those cities. Despite their challenges over the last two thousand years, the tribe has successfully maintained its Culture.
