Both graves bear striking similarities to Buddhist stupas from the Mauryan era. The city also features a historic swimming hole known as the baulia that the monarch frequented for bathing. The town of Sasaram is also home to the well-known Fort at Rohtasgarh. In the seventh century AD, the Fort was constructed.
